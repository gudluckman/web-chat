# Web Based Chat System (UNSW)

A data persistent web chat was developed with Javascript & TypeScript for the backend and React Js for the frontend as part of COMP1531 Major Project in 22T2. As a result of this course, I gained a better understanding of how the backend works and learned how to use APIs.
